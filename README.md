# NeuralBots
The idea is to create a simulation environment to study artificial intelligence and emergence.

## Goal
To create a toy universe with "intelligent" life.

## What will I need?
* Graphics
    * OpenGL
* Physics
    * Simple 2D physics with collisions
    * Low level programming
* Organisms
    * Neural Networks
    * Evolution
    * Sight
    * Smell

## Language choice
* **F#**
    * Strong tool support
    * Balance between high level and mid-low level constructs
    * Easy interop with **C++**
* **Haskell**
    * Decent tool support
    * **Liquid Haskell** provides strong safety
    * Decent interop with **C/C++**
* **Rust**
    * Weak tool support
    * Balance between high level and low level constructs
    * Memory safety without GC => performance
* **TypeScript**
    * Strong tool support
    * No low level constructs
    * No **C/C++** interop
    * Very good type system
    * Can run examples in the browser

I choose **F#** for now.
